# Stibr

Stibr is an **open-source app** that tracks live positionning of vehicules from Brussel's public transportation operator: [STIB](http://www.stib-mivb.be/).

This project is intended as a practical exercice for BeCodians, the junior code warriors from Brussels' best coding school [BeCode.org](https://becode.org).

The project core evolves around Stib's [OpenData API](https://opendata.stib-mivb.be).

This project is built upon the gorgeous open-source php framework [Laravel](http://laravel.com).
